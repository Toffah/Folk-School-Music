    <h2> What is Folk School Music</h2>
        <p> Folk School Music is a repository for song lyrics, with an emphasis on readability.
            The actual lyrics is in focus and the site is designed to be as discrete as possible,
            so when using the site as a teleprompter of sorts it would be easy to read from
        </p>

    <div>
    <h2> How dose Folk School Music work?</h2>
        <p> The site is simplistic and relies on the user group to add more songs to the repository before it can be utilized.
        Add more songs through the "Add Songs" button in the navigation-bar, and they will automatically be added to the navigation bar as a
            entry.
        </p>

    <div>
    <h2> Future plans </h2>
        <p> Per today the site is just a concept and much of the functionality is still missing.
        We strive to add this functionality in the time ahead and look forward to a fully functional product.
            The functionality we are currently looking to implement is user interaction with the site through the "Add songs" functionality,
            a auto scroller function, song search functionality and a karaoke mode.
