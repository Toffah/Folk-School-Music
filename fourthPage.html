        <h1>I Want It That Way</h1>

        <p> Yeah
            Oh yeah
            You are my fire
            The one desire
            Believe when I say
            I want it that way</p>

        <p> But we are two worlds apart
            Can't reach to your heart
            When you say
            That I want it that way</p>

        <p>Tell me why
            Ain't nothin' but a heartache
            Tell me why
            Ain't nothin' but a mistake
            Tell me why
            I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way</p>

        <p>Am I your fire?
            The one, yeah, desire
            Yes, I know that it's too late
            But I want it that way</p>

        <p>Tell me why
            Ain't nothin' but a heartache
            Tell me why
            Ain't nothin' but a mistake (tell me)
            Tell me why
            'Cause I never wanna hear you say
            I want it that way</p>

        <p>Now I can see that we've fallen apart
            From the way that it used to be, yeah
            No matter the distance, I want you to know
            That deep down inside of me</p>

        <p>You are my fire
            The one desire
            You are (you are, you are, you are)</p>

        <p>Don't want to hear you say
            Ain't nothin' but a heartache (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't want to hear you say)
            I never want to hear you say (oh yeah)
            I want it that way</p>

        <p>Tell me why
            Ain't nothin' but a heartache
            Ain't nothin' but a mistake (you better tell me why)
            Tell me why
            I never want to hear you say
            I want it that way
            'Cause I want it that way</p>
